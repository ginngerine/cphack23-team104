Application Concept README
Overview
This repository contains the conceptual framework for an application that handles extensive datasets. It is designed as a prototype and cannot be run in its current state due to the absence of the large dataset it is intended to manage.

OpenAI API Integration
The application is intended to leverage the OpenAI API for certain functionalities. To prepare for actual deployment or testing, an OpenAI API key must be substituted in place of the placeholder key provided within the configuration files.

Backend and Cloud Infrastructure
The backend portion of this concept illustrates our approach to implementing the server infrastructure using AWS cloud services. It lays out a detailed design of how each service within AWS will interact to support the app's functionality.

Frontend User Interface
The frontend files detail the user interface design, showcasing the GUI that has been conceptualized for this app. These files are a visual representation and are part of the display files included.

Note
Please note that this application is currently a theoretical model and is not equipped for actual use without the necessary data and API configurations. The provided files and code serve as a blueprint for understanding the envisioned system architecture and user interaction flow.
