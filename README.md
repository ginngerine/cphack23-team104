This file embodies the conceptual framework for an innovative application designed to manage and manipulate large datasets efficiently. To optimize functionality and ensure seamless data handling, it integrates the OpenAI APIâ€”please remember to replace the placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key to unlock its full potential. On the flip side, the back-end files represent a meticulous blueprint of our server architecture, demonstrating the strategic amalgamation of AWS cloud services to bolster our infrastructure. Meanwhile, the front-end files encapsulate the Graphical User Interface (GUI), as vividly illustrated in the accompanying display files. Dive in and experience the confluence of robust backend engineering and intuitive front-end design!
